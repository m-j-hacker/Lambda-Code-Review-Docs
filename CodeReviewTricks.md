# Code Review Tips and Tricks

## Code Reviews can be difficult...

Writing good, well-thought code reviews for students can sometimes be very difficult. It takes time, care,
and patience to properly discern what feedback the student being reviewed needs to receive in order to
further their learning positively. It can be hard to know where to start...

## ...unless you have ECHO!

Any acronymn would work.

* Error Handling
  - Does the code have guards against bad inputs, invalid prop types, proper tests, etc?
* Code Readability
  - Does the code follow best practices and standard convention? Is there something the student can do
    that would make the code more readable for other developers?
* History (Git)
  - Did the student follow proper git workflow? Did they make plenty of well-written commits?
* Objectives
  - Are all the MVP objectives complete as per README instructions? Which stretch problems did the student
    attempt/complete? Did the student demonstrate understanding of the project instructions?
    
I believe that these are the four major areas that should be checked when writing a review.

Speaking of Code Reviews...

## How should Code Reviews look?

Code Reviews should be delivered in a clean, organized matter, posted along with a list of all of the objectives
in a checklist format, checking off each item on the list the student is able to achieve. This makes it readily
apparent to any viewer of the review which objectives were completed and which were not.

After the checklist of objectives, post an area for your own personal feedback. In it, you should post a few things:

* Great
  - What did the student do well? What did you like? Include a summary of what the student accomplished by
    completing the assignment.
* Requested Improvements
  - What could the student do better to improve their project? What MVP objective(s) is incomplete?
* Questions
  - What feedback would you like the student to give you?
  - Is there something the student did in the project that you would like further explanation about?
* Rating
  - This is a rating from 1-3. 
    - 1 means the MVP objectives were not achieved and/or the application does not run
    - 2 means the MVP objectives were all completed
    - 3 means MVP objectives were complete and at least 1 stretch goal was completed, or the student
      otherwise added upon the expectations of the project in a way comparable to the stretch goals
